# 🛍️ E-commerce Platform Search Function 

This project implements and analyzes two search algorithms — **Linear Search** and **Binary Search** — in the context of an e-commerce platform. It demonstrates how products can be searched efficiently by their names using different search strategies.

---

## 📌 Objective

To simulate a product search feature and compare the performance of:
- **Linear Search** — good for small or unsorted data
- **Binary Search** — optimized for sorted data

---

## 🧩 Key Concepts

- **Big O Notation**: Measures algorithm performance
- **Linear Search**: Scans each item until match found (O(n))
- **Binary Search**: Divides search space in half each time (O(log n)) — requires sorted data

---

## 🛠️ Technologies

- **Language**: Java
- **IDE**: Any Java IDE or command-line compiler
- **Data Structure**: `List<Product>`

---

## 📂 Files

- `SearchEngine.java` — contains all classes and logic in a single file

---

## 🧪 Sample Output

Linear Search Result: Laptop (ID: 102, Category: Electronics)
Binary Search Result: Laptop (ID: 102, Category: Electronics)

---

## 📊 Time Complexity Comparison
- Search Type	Best Case	Average Case	Worst Case
- Linear Search	O(1)	O(n)	O(n)
- Binary Search	O(1)	O(log n)	O(log n)

## 📚 Conclusion
- Use Linear Search when data is small or unsorted

- Use Binary Search when data is sorted and large

- Binary search is generally more efficient for scalable systems
