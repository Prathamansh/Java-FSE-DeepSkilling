1. Time Complexity:
Method	        Time Complexity	           Space Complexity
----------------------------------------------------------------
Recursive	        O(n)	               O(n) call stack

2. Optimization Tips:
(a) Avoid stack overflow by using iteration or memoization.
(b) Recursive method is elegant, but inefficient for large n.
(c) Use loop-based approach for performance in production.
